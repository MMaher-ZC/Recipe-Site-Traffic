# Recipe Website Data Science Project

## Project Overview

This project analyzes recipe data using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **machine learning**, and **statistical analysis** to derive insights and trends. We implemented various **data visualization techniques** and built a **presentation** to showcase results with key performance indicators (KPIs).

The main goals of this project were:
- Understanding recipe trends and patterns.
- Predicting recipe success based on user reviews and ratings.
- Creating a **user-friendly report** for business stakeholders.

## Tools and Libraries
The following tools and libraries were used:
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib**: Data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For executing code and creating visualizations.
- **PowerPoint**: For business presentations.

## Key Features
1. **Data Analysis & Cleaning**: 
    - Cleaned and prepared the recipe dataset.
    - Performed statistical analysis to identify key trends such as ingredient usage, cooking time distribution, and more.
    
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
    - Visualized recipe distributions, user ratings, and cooking techniques using **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**.
    - Insights into the most common ingredients, popular cuisines, and cooking styles.

3. **Machine Learning**:
    - Built predictive models using **Scikit-learn** to classify recipes based on user ratings.
    - Compared different algorithms such as **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **SVM** to find the best-performing model.

4. **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**:
    - Defined KPIs to track recipe performance, such as:
      - Average user rating per recipe.
      - Success prediction accuracy.
      - Top ingredients by rating.

5. **Business Presentation**:
    - Created a **business-friendly report** showcasing key insights and machine learning results.
    - Highlighted actionable insights and strategic recommendations for recipe improvements based on data analysis.

## Visualizations
- Trend analysis of popular recipes and ingredients.
- Heatmaps, bar charts, and scatter plots for data exploration.
- KPIs presented through dashboards to summarize key outcomes.

## Results
- Successfully predicted recipe ratings with an accuracy of **X%** (update based on your results).
- Discovered the most commonly used ingredients in top-rated recipes.
- Provided insights for business decision-making to improve recipe suggestions and user engagement.
